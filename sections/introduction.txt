This project combines Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
and The Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) data
from two different time periods (1967 and 2007)
to present a snapshot of the economy,
and the demographic characteristics of the workers that drove the economy,
in those respective times.
Because the BEA has altered its methodology over the decades,
the data for 1967 and 2007 are not available in directly comparable forms.
As a result,
the procedure for the 1967 data and the 2007 data
differ significantly in the details of execution.
However, in broad terms,
the procedures for the two time periods are essentially the same.

The following, relatively brief,
outline of procedure will be written in terms broad enough
that there will be little distinction between
the 1967 and 2007 procedures.
It should, however,
give the reader a basic overview of what was
a lengthy and technically complex project.
