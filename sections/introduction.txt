This project combines Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and The Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) data from two different time periods (1967 and 2007) to present a snapshot of industry, and demographic characteristics of the workers that drove that industry in those respective times.
Because the BEA has altered its methodology over the decades, the data for 1967 and 2007 are not available in directly comparable forms.
As a result, the procedure for the 1967 data and the 2007 data differ significantly in the details of execution.
However, in broad terms, the procedures for the two time periods are essentially the same.

The following, relatively brief, outline of procedure will be written in terms broad enough that there will be little distinction between the 1957 and 2008 procedures.
This outline will not be even close to sufficient to replicate the methodology used in this project.
It should, however, give the reader a basic overview and of context of what was a lengthy and technically complex procedure.
Later sections in this chapter will explore each element of the procedure in detail.
