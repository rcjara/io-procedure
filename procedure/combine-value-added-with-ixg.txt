Going back to the Industry to Industry use table,
the various government final sue consuming industries
(e.g. "Federal Government nondefense: Consumption expenditures", etc.)
are aggregated into a single Government consuming industry.
That Government consuming industry,
as well as the Investment and Exports consuming industries,
are set aside as an Investment, Exports, Government table (IXG Table).

This paragraph describes a procedure largely similar to the one in step five,
expect that it is applied to the IXG Table instead of the PCE bridge table.
The producing industries in the IXG Bridge Table are relabeled as consuming industries and joined with the Value Added Ratio table.
This temporarily creates a three dimensional matrix,
with its axes being Category by Consuming Industry, by Producing Industry.
Each Producing Industry ratio is multiplied by the dollar value of its Consuming Industry.
The producing industries are aggregated by category,
dropping the consuming industry out of the matrix
and returning the matrix to two dimensions.
The imports industry of this new matrix is relabeled as "Indirect Imports",
and the "Direct Imports" that were set aside are added back to the matrix,
creating a "Value Added by IXG" table.

Finally the Value Added by Category table is combined with the Value Added by IXG table,
to create a Value Added by Category, Investment, Exports, and Government table
(Value Added by CIXG Table).
