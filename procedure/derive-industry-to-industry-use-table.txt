heading: Derive 2007 Industry to Industry Use Table
body:
We combine the 2007 Make and Use tables
in order to derive the 2007 Industry to Industry Use Table.
First, all of the value added and totals rows from the Use table are temporarily discarded.
The column totals for these
Then the cells in both tables are reduced to proportions:
each cell in either table is divided by column total,
which results in the use table's cells representing proportions of total industry output (less value added),
and the make table's cells represented proportions of total commodity output.

The make table is then multiplied by the use table using standard matrix multiplication,
resulting in a new table
from which the commodity elements have been dropped
and the columns sum to 1.
For this procedure, we refer to the column industries as "consuming industries"
and the row industries as "producing industries".
Each cell of this new matrix is multiplied by the total output of its consuming industry.
The discarded value added and intermediate output rows are added back into the table,
resulting in the 2007 industry to industry use table.
