heading: Derive 2007 Industry to Industry Use Table
body:
In order to derive the 2007 Industry to Industry Use Table,
both the 2007 Make and Use tables are combined as follows.
First, all of the value added rows from the Use table are temporarily discarded.
Then the cells in both tables are reduced to proportions.
Each cell in the use table is divided by its industry total,
while each cell in the make table is divided by its commodity total.
These percentage tables are joined together by commodity,
resulting in a 3 dimension matrix with the axes
Producing Industry by Commodity by Consuming Industry.
Each cell of commodity and consuming multiplied by each other
and totaled by producing industry.
The commodities are then dropped,
creating a two dimensional matrix of producing industry by consuming industry.
Each cell of this new matrix is multiplied by the total output of its consuming industry.
The discarded value added and intermediate output rows are added back into the table,
resulting in the 2007 industry to industry use table.
