Each PCE item on the PCE Bridge Table is categorized into one of these eight categories:
Food,
Transportation,
Clothing & Personal Care,
Business Services,
Recreation and Leisure,
Personal Services,
Housing and  Household Operations,
Education,
and Health.
For each of these eight eight categories,
the value for the transportation columns in the PCE bridge table is aggregated into an appropriate transportation producing industry.
Similarly, the aggregate value of the wholesale margin of the PCE bridge table is added to the wholesale producing industry,
as is the aggregate of the retail margin column added to the retail producing industry.
Finally, the value (in producer's value) for each category is aggregated by the producing industry.

The producing industries in the PCE Bridge Table are relabeled as consuming industries and joined with the Value Added Ratio table.
This temporarily creates a three dimensional matrix,
with its axes being Category by Consuming Industry, by Producing Industry.
Each Producing Industry ratio is multiplied by the dollar value of its Consuming Industry.
The producing industries are aggregated by category,
dropping the consuming industry out of the matrix
and returning the matrix to two dimensions.
The imports industry of this new matrix is relabeled as "Indirect Imports",
and the "Direct Imports" that were set aside are added back to the matrix,
creating a "Value Added by Category" table.
