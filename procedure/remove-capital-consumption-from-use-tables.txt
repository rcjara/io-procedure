The industry to industry use table for both years is altered to remove the effects of capital consumption.
Using data from the BEA National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables,
the total capital consumed by each consuming industry in the use table is calculated
(in many cases, this total is zero).
This capital consumption is added,
as additional required input,
to specific industries that contribute to capital consumption.
The profits of each consuming industry are then reduced by the cost increase.
This ensures a consuming industry's total output remains the same,
even though the total of the producing industries has increased.
The new table produced by this procedure may be called an Industry to Industry Use Table with Capital Consumption Removed.
