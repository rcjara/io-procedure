Once the industry proportion of imports table is created,
a new producing industry, "direct imports", is added to the value added table based on this proportion.
The cells in this producing industry are set to the proportion of imports multiplied by the total value of the consuming industry.
The remaining cells in each consuming industry are then reduced by a proportion sufficient to main the original total of the consuming industry.

Finally, each cell is divided by the total value of the consuming industry,
so that the total value for each consuming industry becomes 1.
This converts the value added table into a "Value Added Ratio Table".
