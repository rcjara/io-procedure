The following procedure is conducted twice,
once on 1967 data, and once on 2007 data.
The procedure is divided into two main sections:
determining which industries add value to various sectors of the economy,
and combining that value added data with worker demographics.
The determination of value added produces interesting results by itself,
but is also necessary for the later step of combining value added with workers demographics.
