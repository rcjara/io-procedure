Returning to the Value Added by PCEs plus IXG Table (step 6), row totals for each producing industry are calculated.
Each cell in a row is then divided by the row total.
This creates a new Ratio of Value Added to PCEs plus IXG by Industry table.

The Recoded CPS Dataset is copied, creating a new dataset.
Each worker entry in the new dataset is replicated enough times so that there are identical copies of each worker for every PCE as well as a worker for investment, exports and government.
In the 1967 dataset, this results in 80 copies and 87 copies in the 2007 dataset.
For every worker, each of the copies is assigned to a different element of PCEs plus IXG.
For each copy of every worker,
the worker’s industry and the copy’s segment of PCEs plus IXG is used to look up
the ratio of value that copy of the worker adds to that segment in the Ratio of Value Added to Pces plus IXG by Industry table.
That copy’s probability weight (p-weight) is then multiplied by the ratio.
In this manner, the sum of the p-weights of all copies of the worker will equal the original p-weight of the worker before his or her entry was replicated.
This new dataset is called the Recoded Dataset with PCEs plus IXG.
