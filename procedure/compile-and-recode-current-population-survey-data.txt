All of the following steps are applied to 1967 and 2007 separately.
Three years worth of CPS data (1967-1969 for 1967 and 2007-2009 for 2007) are downloaded.
All unemployed or not in the labor force persons are dropped and wages are adjusted to 2009 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.
Quintiles of wages are calculated for all people, for men alone, and for women alone.
All people are classified into 5 age groups, as well as 5 education levels.
All people are also classified into 21 categories of occupations, as well as 15 categories of industry/occupation combinations.
Because Census industry codes are not directly comparable to BEA industry codes, the Census industry codes are converted to BEA industry codes by means of a Census to BEA industry code crosswalk.
Finally, after the BEA industry codes are present, each BEA industry is further categorized in to the ten industry categories discussed in step 8.
This recoded CPS dataset will be referred to as the Recoded CPS Dataset.
