heading: Adjust Import Totals
body:
The above steps resulted in totals of imports (both direct and indirect) for
PCEs, Imports, Exports, and Government that were inconsistent with #### some other totals.
To remedy this descripency, imports were adjusted accordingly.
The 8 categories of PCEs are temporarily aggregated into a single PCE total.
For each item of PCEs and IXG,
a total imports was calculated (direct + indirect) and compared to the expected total imports.
For IXG, both direct and indirect imports are multipled by an amount necessary to bring their total up to the expected value.
The, all the other producing industries are multiplied by an amount necessary to preserve the total value of that segment of IXG.
For PCEs, a ratio is calculated that would be necessary to bring all of the PCE imports up to the previously published totals, as well as a ratio to multiply the other producing industries by what would be necessary to preserve the aggregate total of PCEs.
The aggregate total is then discarded, and the individual eight categories each have their imports
(both direct and indirect)
multiplied by the appropriate ratio,
as well as their other producing industries multiplied by the other ratio.
