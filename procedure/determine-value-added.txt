During this step,
the total output of each industry (or final use) s accounted fro purely in terms of value directly and indirectly added to an industry.
It should be noted that at the end of this process,
the total of all industries' value added will be well above GDP.
This is not a problem,
as this value added table will be used only for its ratios.
E.g., approximately 6.8% of the value added to the industry "Oil and Gas Extraction"
comes from the "Pipeline Transportation" industry.

The first step is to calculate a direct requirements ratio table.
For each consuming industry,
the three value added "producing industries" are combined to create a single value added industry.
Then a total output is calculated,
and each producing industry's contribution to that consuming industry is divided by that consuming industry's total output.
