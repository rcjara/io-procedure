For each dataset a series of tables with identical columns are produced, but depending on the dataset, the rows represent different values.
For the Recoded CPS Dataset, the rows represent all workers in a BEA Industry code.
For the Recoded Dataset with CIXG, the rows represent workers contribution to one of the eleven elements of CIXG.
For the Recoded Dataset with PCEs plus IXG, the rows represent workersâ€™ contribution to either a specific PCE, or investment, exports, or government.

Each table is produced three times for each dataset, once with all workers in the dataset, and once with men, or women.
Most tables tables are produced with each cell representing the total number of workers belonging both to the row category and column category.

Of these tables, the following column categories are used:
Income Quintiles,
Age Category,
Education Level,
21 Occupation Categories,
15 Occupation and Industry Categories.

In addition, tables with the median and mean number of hours worked per year,
as well as median and mean incomes are also produced for each dataset,
for all workers, for men, and for women.
