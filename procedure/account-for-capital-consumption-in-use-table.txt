heading: Alter Use Tables to take Capital Consumption into Account
body:
The industry to industry use table for both years is altered to take into account
the effects of capital consumption.
Using a combination of data available in National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables
and Bea Capital Flow Tables
(which were unfortunately not available for the years examined in this study)
we estimate the amount of capital consumption each producing industry in the use table accumulated that year
for each consuming industry.
For a more detailed explanation of this procedure,
please see the next section of the chapter where we discuss differences in procedure between the two periods.

That capital consumption is added as additional required input
to the appropriate cell in the producing industry.
The profits of each consuming industry are then reduced by the cost increase.
This ensures a consuming industry's total output remains the same,
even though the total of the producing industries has increased.
What is left is a use table in which the effects of capital consumption have been taking into account.
