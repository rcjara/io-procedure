Introduction

This project combines Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and The Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) data from two different time periods (1967 and 2007) to present a snapshot of industry, and demographic characteristics of the workers that drove that industry in those respective times.  Because the BEA has altered its methodology over the decades, the data for 1967 and 2007 are not available in directly comparable forms.  As a result, the procedure for the 1967 data and the 2007 data differ significantly in the details of execution.  However, in broad terms, the procedures for the two time periods are essentially the same.

The following, relatively brief, outline of procedure will be written in terms broad enough that there will be little distinction between the 1957 and 2008 procedures.  This outline will not be even close to sufficient to replicate the methodology used in this project.  It should, however, give the reader a basic overview and of context of what was a lengthy and technically complex procedure.  Later sections in this chapter will explore each element of the procedure in detail.


Basic vocabulary

In order to make sense of any description of the procedure, some basic vocabulary is necessary.

BEA Benchmark Input-Output Accounts - On a semi-regular basis, the BEA produces accounts of the US economy which show, in dollars, how much output is produced by industries, how much of a given commodity  an industry must consume in order to produce its output, and what output is consumed by final uses (e.g., exports, personal consumption expenditures or government spending).  These accounts are released in both summary level (dividing the economy into approximately 100 industries) and the detailed level (dividing the economy in to approximately 400 industries).  This project only makes use of summary level data.


Use Table - Use tables are one of the three major tables released in the benchmark input-output accounts (the others being make tables and bridge tables).  A use table is a matrix of industries and commodities which represents the total output of the economy in a single year.  Its columns represent either industries, final uses, or various totals derived by summing rows or parts of rows.  Its rows represent either commodities or totals derived by summing columns or parts of columns.  If a column represents an industry, any cell in that column represents the amount (in millions of dollars) of a commodity that were used by that industry in order to produce that industry's output for the year.  If a column represents a final use, a single cell represents the amount of that commodity consumed by the final use (e.g.  U.S.  consumers).  The use table includes several value added "commodities": wages paid to workers, taxes paid to the government, and profits.

Make Table - Make tables are one of the three major tables released in the benchmark input-output accounts (the others being use tables and bridge tables).  A make table is a matrix of commodities and industries which represents the total value of all of the commodities produced in a single year.  A cell of the matrix represents how much (in millions of dollars) of a given commodity (the column) was produced by a given industry (the row).

Industry to Industry Use Table - An industry to Industry use table is a matrix very similar to a normal use table, except that both its columns and its rows represent industries.  A single cell represents the total output (in millions of dollars) from one industry (the row) that is consumed by another industry (the column) to produce the column industry's total output.  For the rest of this chapter, the column industries will be referred to as "consuming industries", as they consume the output of the row industries.  The row industries will be referred to as "producing industries", as they produce the output which is then consumed by the consuming industries.  Each industry appears in an Industry to Industry Use table twice, once as a producing industry, and once as a consuming industry.  An industry to industry use table can be derived by combining a make table and a use table, and the procedure to do so is discussed later in this chapter.

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Bridge Table - A PCE bridge table contains lists of types of expenditures by industries that produce the good or service.  Many expenditures are listed multiple times, as many industries produced that good or service that year.  Columns include the value of the good in producer's prices, transportation expenses, wholesale and retail trade margins, and the value of the good purchaser's prices.  The total value of the purchaser's prices is the same as the total value of the PCE column in the use table for the same year.


The procedure outlined below is conducted twice, once on data from 1967 and once on data from 2007.  The only difference between the 1967 and 2007 procedure that will be discussed is that in 2007, an industry to industry use table is derived as the very first step.  This is unnecessary in 1967, as its use table was already in an industry to industry form.

In order to derive the 2007 Industry to Industry Use Table, both the 2007 Make and Use tables are combined as follows.  First, all of the value added rows from the Use table are temporarily discarded .  Then the cells in both tables are reduced to proportions.  Each cell in the use table is divided by its industry total, while each cell in the make table is divided by its commodity total.  These percentage tables are joined together by commodity, resulting in a 3 dimension matrix with the axes Producing Industry by Commodity by Consuming Industry.  Each cell of commodity and consuming multiplied by each other and totaled by producing industry.  The commodities are then dropped, creating a two dimensional matrix of producing industry by consuming industry.  Each cell of this new matrix is multiplied by the total output of its consuming industry.  The discarded value added and intermediate output rows are added back into the table, resulting in the 2007 industry to industry use table.

From this point on, any procedure done to one year can be assumed to be done to both.

The industry to industry use table for both years is altered to remove the effects of capital consumption.  Using data from the BEA National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables, the total capital consumed by each consuming industry in the use table is calculated (in many cases, this total is zero).  This capital consumption is added, as additional required input, to specific industries that contribute to capital consumption.  The profits of each consuming industry are then reduced by the cost increase.  This ensures a consuming industry's total output remains the same, even though the total of the producing industries has increased.  The new table produced by this procedure may be called an Industry to Industry Use Table with Capital Consumption Removed.


During this step, the total output of each industry (or final use) s accounted fro purely in terms of value directly and indirectly added to an industry.  It should be noted that at the end of this process, the total of all industries' value added will be well above GDP.  This is not a problem, as this value added table will be used only for its ratios.  E.g., approximately 6.8% of the value added to the industry "Oil and Gas Extraction" comes from the "Pipeline Transportation" industry.

The first step is to calculate a direct requirements ratio table.  For each consuming industry, the three value added "producing industries" are combined to create a single value added industry.  Then a total output is calculated, and each producing industry's contribution to that consuming industry is divided by that consuming industry's total output.

A new value added table is created which is a replica of the industry to industry use table except that all of its cells are filled with zeros, except for the cells where the producing and consuming industries are the same industry.  The value of those cells is set to the value of the value add for that industry in the use table.

Using the direct requirements ratio, the industry to industry use table with capital consumption removed, and the new value added table, an iterative process is undertaken which calculates value indirectly added to each industry.  At each sept of the process:

1) In the industry to industry use table, each cell is decreased by its producing industry's value added ratio.  The amout that the cell is decreased by is added to the corresponding cell in the new value added table.

2) For each column in the industry to industry use table, the remaining value in each cell is redistributed in the column at a rate determined by the producing industry's corresponding consuming industry's column in the direct requirements ratio table.

As the iterative process proceeds, the total of all the cells in the industry to industry Use table approaches zero, while the total of all the cells in the value added table approaches the original total of the industry to industry use table.  The only exception to this is that, as the value an industry adds to itself is already accounted for, at each step of the process, any cell in which the consuming and producing industries are the same industry is replaced with a zero.  The process is repeated 16 times, ensuring that the total of the cells in the value added table is over 99.9% of the original total of the industry to industry use table.
