Introduction

This project combines Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and The Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) data from two different time periods (1967 and 2007) to present a snapshot of industry, and demographic characteristics of the workers that drove that industry in those respective times.  Because the BEA has altered its methodology over the decades, the data for 1967 and 2007 are not available in directly comparable forms.  As a result, the procedure for the 1967 data and the 2007 data differ significantly in the details of execution.  However, in broad terms, the procedures for the two time periods are essentially the same.

The following, relatively brief, outline of procedure will be written in terms broad enough that there will be little distinction between the 1957 and 2008 procedures.  This outline will not be even close to sufficient to replicate the methodology used in this project.  It should, however, give the reader a basic overview and of context of what was a lengthy and technically complex procedure.  Later sections in this chapter will explore each element of the procedure in detail.


Basic vocabulary

In order to make sense of any description of the procedure, some basic vocabulary is necessary.

BEA Benchmark Input-Output Accounts - On a semi-regular basis, the BEA produces accounts of the US economy which show, in dollars, how much output is produced by industries, how much of a given commodity  an industry must consume in order to produce its output, and what output is consumed by final uses (e.g., exports, personal consumption expenditures or government spending).  These accounts are released in both summary level (dividing the economy into approximately 100 industries) and the detailed level (dividing the economy in to approximately 400 industries).  This project only makes use of summary level data.
