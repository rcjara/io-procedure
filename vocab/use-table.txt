Use Table -
Use tables are one of the three major tables released in the benchmark input-output accounts
(the others being make tables and bridge tables).
A use table is a matrix of industries and commodities which represents the total output of the economy in a single year.
Its columns represent either industries, final uses, or various totals derived by summing rows or parts of rows.
Its rows represent either commodities or totals derived by summing columns or parts of columns.
If a column represents an industry,
any cell in that column represents the amount (in millions of dollars) of a commodity that were used by that industry in order to produce that industry's output for the year.
If a column represents a final use,
a single cell represents the amount of that commodity consumed by the final use
(e.g. U.S. consumers).
The use table includes several value added "commodities":
wages paid to workers, taxes paid to the government, and profits.
