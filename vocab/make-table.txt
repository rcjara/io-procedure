Make Table -
Make tables are one of the three major tables released in the benchmark input-output accounts
(the others being use tables and bridge tables).
A make table is a matrix of commodities and industries which represents the total value of all of the commodities produced in a single year.
A cell of the matrix represents how much (in millions of dollars)
of a given commodity (the column)
was produced by a given industry (the row).
