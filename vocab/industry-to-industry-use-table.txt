Industry to Industry Use Table -
An industry to Industry use table is a matrix very similar to a normal use table,
except that both its columns and its rows represent industries.
A single cell represents the total output (in millions of dollars)
from one industry (the row)
that is consumed by another industry (the column)
to produce the column industry's total output.
For the rest of this chapter,
the column industries will be referred to as "consuming industries",
as they consume the output of the row industries.
The row industries will be referred to as "producing industries",
as they produce the output which is then consumed by the consuming industries.
Each industry appears in an Industry to Industry Use table twice,
once as a producing industry,
and once as a consuming industry.
An industry to industry use table can be derived by combining a make table and a use table,
and the procedure to do so is discussed later in this chapter.
