Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Bridge Table -
A PCE bridge table contains lists of types of expenditures by industries that produce the good or service.
Many expenditures are listed multiple times, as many industries produced that good or service that year.
Columns include
the value of the good in producer's prices,
transportation expenses,
wholesale and retail trade margins,
and the value of the good purchaser's prices.
The total value of the purchaser's prices is the same as the total value of the PCE column in the use table for the same year.
