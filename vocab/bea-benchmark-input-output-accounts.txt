BEA Benchmark Input-Output Accounts - On a semi-regular basis, the BEA produces accounts of the US economy which show, in dollars, how much output is produced by industries, how much of a given commodity  an industry must consume in order to produce its output, and what output is consumed by final uses (e.g., exports, personal consumption expenditures or government spending).
These accounts are released in both summary level (dividing the economy into approximately 100 industries) and the detailed level (dividing the economy in to approximately 400 industries).
This project only makes use of summary level data.
